        <header>American Bittern</header>
        <p>The American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus) is a species of wading bird in the heron family. It has a Nearctic distribution, breeding in Canada and the northern and central parts of the United States, and wintering in the U.S. Gulf Coast states, all of Florida into the Everglades, the Caribbean islands and parts of Central America.</p>
        <p>The American Bittern's inimitable call has earned it some unusual monikers, including “thunder-pumper,” “belcher-squelcher,” and “bog bull.” Does it warrant such impressive names? Definitely. To attract mates and claim breeding grounds, males gulp down pockets of air, which are released in a series of hypnotically weird drip-like sounds, each comprised of three syllables: pump-er-lunk.</p>

        <header>Musician Wren</header>
        <p>The musician wren generally inhabits the lower levels of humid forest; in Brazil it is also found in várzea. In elevation in mostly ranges from sea level to 500 m (1,600 ft) but is found occasionally as high as 1,000 m (3,300 ft) and even, in Venezuela, to 1,400 m (4,600 ft).</p>
        <p>One of the bird world's apex singers, the Musician Wren produces an astonishing melody that has earned comparison to Bach and Haydn. Despite its iconic status in the Amazon, where the bird figures in local legends, it wasn't until 2013 that researchers succeeded in understanding why its song sounds so musical to our ears. The answer lies in the wren's use of consonant intervals, i.e., complementary notes — specifically, its ability to string together perfect octave, fifth, and fourth intervals.</p>

        <header>Gunnison Sage-Grouse</header>
        <p>This species is in decline because of loss of habitat; their range has shrunk. Following petitions, the species was proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and was eventually protected as a threatened species starting on December 22, 2014. The known population size of this species remains quite small, and it was estimated that fewer than 4,000 individuals existed in when the species was successfully protected under the Act. A 2019 survey found the population in Colorado to be reduced to an estimated 1,800 birds with only around 429 reproductive males, a record low for the species since surveys began.</p>
        <p>In the spring, dozens, sometimes hundreds, of male Gunnison Sage-Grouse congregate in leks where they participate in elaborate courtship displays designed to attract the attention of onlooking females. Males begin by inflating yellow air sacs on either side of their necks and sliding them under their wings to generate a swishing sound — similar to rustling sheets. Next comes the finale: With a violent thrust, males pump their chests upward, slapping their air sacs together to deliver a rapid, bubble-like plop-ploop.</p>

        <header>Leach's Storm-Petrel</header>
        <p>It breeds on inaccessible islands in the colder northern areas of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It nests in colonies close to the sea in well concealed areas such as rock crevices, shallow burrows, or even logs. It lays a single white egg, which often has a faint ring of purple spots at the large end. This storm petrel is strictly nocturnal at the breeding sites to avoid predation by gulls and skuas, and even avoids coming to land on clear, moonlit nights. The largest colony of Leach's storm petrels can be found on Baccalieu Island off eastern Canada, an ecological reserve with ~1.95 million pairs of the birds at last estimate in 2013.</p>
        <p>For a bird that spends much of its time silent and alone at sea, the Leach's Storm-Petrel is a surprisingly talented singer. At coastal nesting burrows, this storm-petrel's purrs and chatter-like sounds, employed by both sexes, are thought to play an important role in mate selection, pair bonding, recognition, and nest defense, although human listeners often just interpret them as “cute” or “adorable." After all, it's not every day you hear birds that sound like rubber toys and vroom like cartoon cars.</p>

        <header>Capuchinbird</header>
        <p>The capuchinbird or calfbird (Perissocephalus tricolor) is a large passerine bird of the family Cotingidae. It is monotypic within the genus Perissocephalus. It is found in humid forests (up to 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) but mostly below 600 m) in north-eastern South America, almost entirely north of the Amazon River and east of Rio Negro (Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil and The Guianas).</p>
        <p>Without uttering a sound, the bald-headed Capuchinbird has little trouble standing out, but this bird's unique qualities are more than skin deep. During breeding season, the male Capuchinbird inflates air sacs around its neck, then deflates them, belting out an eerie, buzzing grrrrraaaaaaaaaooooooooooooooo. Occasionally compared to the whine of a chainsaw or, less convincingly, to a cow's moo, the Capuchinbird's marvelously strange call is out of this world.</p>

        <header>White Bellbird</header>
        <p>The white bellbird (Procnias albus) is a species of bird in the family Cotingidae. It is the world’s loudest bird, producing vocalizations of up to 125.4 decibels. The specific epithet is often spelled alba, but albus is correct due to the masculine gender of "Procnias". It is found in forests in the Guianas, with small numbers in Venezuela and the Brazilian state of Pará, as well as Trinidad and Tobago and Panama. As in two other members of Procnias, the males have wattles, fleshy structures akin to the red skin flap that hangs from the throat of roosters.</p>
        <p>These tropical birds produce the loudest avian sounds on Earth. Three times more intense than the Screaming Piha — the world's second loudest bird — the White Bellbird's call was measured at 125 decibels, which is comparable to a jackhammer. In case you were wondering, the skin hanging from this bird's bill — known as a wattle — is similar to that found on roosters and is used to woo potential mates. </p>

        <header>Club-winged Manakin</header>
        <p>The club-winged manakin (Machaeropterus deliciosus) is a small passerine bird which is a resident breeding species in the cloud forest on the western slopes of the Andes Mountains of Colombia and northwestern Ecuador. The manakins are a family (Pipridae) of small bird species of subtropical and tropical Central and South America.</p>
        <p>The finest bird sounds may be sung, but the most unusual are … vibrated. By rubbing its special club-shaped secondary wing feathers against one another at the dizzying speed of 107 times per second — the fastest limb movement yet observed in a vertebrate — the Club-winged Manakin is able to produce a bizarre electronic-like sound. This astonishing three-syllable “call,” which begins with two abbreviated ticks followed by a longer segment, bic-bic-burrrr, may bring to mind the melodic qualities of a metal detector, but it's music to the ears of female Club-winged Manakins, which mate with the most impressive “singers.”</p>
